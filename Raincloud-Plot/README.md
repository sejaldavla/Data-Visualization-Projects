# Why do graphs in an academic paper have to be boring?

As an academic researcher, I used only a few chart types (mostly bar graphs and box plots) to show my data. I believe in open data sharing and reproducibility.
Sometimes my own work did not reflect those values. 
This is an attempt to make a visualization that shows data distribution, raw data, and summary statistics in the same plot so that the readers will have a better understanding of my data.
